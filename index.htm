            <div class="box">
                <p>Corona viruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness
                    in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known
                    to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more
                    severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)
                    and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently
                    discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19. <br> <br>
                <h3>What is COVID-19 </h3><br>
                COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently
                discovered corona virus. This new virus and disease were unknown
                before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.</p>

            <div class="box">
                <h3>What are the symptoms of COVID-19</h3> <br>
                <p>The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and
                dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal
                congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are
                usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but
                don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people
                (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special
                treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19
                becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people,
                and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure,
                heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.
                People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical
                attention.

                <h3>How to protect yourself</h3><br>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                    <li> Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol based hand rub or wash them with soap and
                    water.</li>
                    
                    
                    <li>Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and
                    anyone who is coughing or sneezing.</li>
                    
                    <li>Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.</li>
                    
                    <li>Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good
                    respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose
                    with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then
                    dispose of the used tissue immediately.</li>
                   
                    <li>Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and
                    difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance.
                    Follow the directions of your local health authority.</li>
                    
                   <li>Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local
                    areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid
                    traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or
                    have diabetes, heart or lung disease.</li>

                        <p>
                            Q: What are the early symptoms of COVID-19?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A: Everyone should know the symptoms – for most people, it starts with a fever and a dry cough, not a runny nose. Most people will have mild disease and get better without needing any special care.

                            <p>
                                Q: Can COVID-19 be transmitted through food?
                
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A: There is currently no evidence that people can catch COVID-19 from food. The virus that causes COVID-19 can be killed at temperatures similar to that of other known viruses and bacteria found in food.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Q: How dangerous is COVID-19?
                
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A: Although for most people COVID-19 causes only mild illness, it can make some people very ill. More rarely, the disease can be fatal. Older people, and those with pre- existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes) appear to be more vulnerable.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Q: What is the recovery time for the coronavirus disease?
                
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A: Using available preliminary data, the median time from onset to clinical recovery for mild cases is approximately 2 weeks and is 3-6 weeks for patients with severe or critical disease.
